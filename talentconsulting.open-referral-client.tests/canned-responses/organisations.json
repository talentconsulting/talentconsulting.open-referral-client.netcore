    "description": "Sight Support is a registered charity that works with visually impaired people and their families across Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire. Our aim is to ensure that people living with a visual impairment across the West of England can lead active and fulfilled lives.  \n \nThe charity was established in April 2018 (previously as Vision West of England) through a collaboration between the Thomas Pocklington Trust and Wiltshire Sight, in response to a needs assessment which showed that people in Bristol, Bath and South Gloucestershire living with sight loss did not have access to appropriate local support services.  In the absence of any local sight loss charity in the area, the new charity was formed to build local services which are driven by the needs of blind and partially sighted people and which fill an established gap in service provision.\n\nSight Support staff now operate from two hubs, in Bristol and Devizes in Wiltshire, where we continue to work under the banner of Wiltshire Sight.\n\nOur dedicated team can provide the answers to your questions; signpost you to support groups, offer advice for family and carers or make a referral for you to access support from one of our partner organisations.  If you or someone you know is visually impaired, we’re here to help.",

    "description": "Now in its 13th year and more commonly known simply as “GOLDIES,\" our founder is the highly respected Bath-based musician Grenville Jones who recognised how singing and music, brightened the lives and wellbeing of the many people across his choirs. Grenville himself took the first daytime singing and activity sessions in sheltered housing community rooms in and around Bath back in 2007. There are now 225 fun daytime sessions in community rooms, church halls and libraries across England and Wales - taken by 70 dedicated freelance leaders. Grenville is always anxious to point out however that the charity he started, GOLDIES is NOT a choir, but singing the popular memory-evoking hits of the 60s and onwards lies at the heart of all it does. GOLDIES recognises the issues of loneliness amongst the increasing older population. It gives vulnerable people a REASON to get out, to be with others, laugh, sing out, and to make new friends.",

    "description": "Welcome to the Keeping Bristol Safe Partnership. The partnership is a group of people that discuss the best ways to keep Bristol safe. They look at keeping children safe, keeping adults safe, and how to protect whole communities. The Keeping Bristol Safe Partnership started in June 2019 and officially came together in September 2019 because changes were needed to the way Bristol worked before.\n\nNew laws made by the government say that the main members need to be from Bristol City Council, BNSSG Clinical commissioning group, and Avon and Somerset Constabulary. The group is also made up of members from other groups that work directly in the community. These would include people from health, education and what’s known as the voluntary sector, which are organisations working in the community that sometimes are given money from charities and sometimes from Bristol City Council.\n\nThe Keeping Bristol Safe Partnership is led by Ivan Powell. He is known as the Chair of Keeping Bristol Safe Partnership and is there to check that work is completed and if there are things that could have been done better. He keeps everyone focused on their work to achieve the main goal at the end.\n\nKeeping Bristol Safe Partnership has set priorities. Priorities are similar to goals that they set so that they can help people in Bristol to feel safer, which KBSP achieve by completing work. The work is carried out by these three groups; Keeping Children Safe; Keeping Adults Safe; Keeping Communities Safe. These are then split into smaller groups called sub-groups, and task and finish groups.",

To love. To understand. To empower. To support. In the centre of our ‘tree’ logo is the word ‘love’, written in Chinese, to depict branches of compassion reaching out to people in their time of need.\n\nThe simple and compassionate act of giving people food on a weekly basis has created a safe and positive environment to build relationship and gain an understanding of each person’s circumstances. This allows us to engage on a much deeper level - to get to the heart of the problem, and then support people to move from crisis to independence in the best possible way.",

These are shared homes for between 7 and 14 people across the whole area we work. Freeways Trust also rent shared houses and flats to adults with a learning disability directly and we support those individuals to manage their tenancies and reach their potential.\n\nWe liaise with other professionals to ensure we all work together to support people as individuals, helping them to have a voice and support others to listen.\n\nWe strongly believe that all people should live a life that is free from abuse and we work closely with a number of the local safeguarding adults boards to ensure the voices of people with learning disabilities are central to the work they do.\n\nFor more information about any of our services, please contact us.",

We are passionate about improving children’s services and lives. Whether we’re dealing with an eight year old child or a director, we maintain the highest standards. We do this by employing people who have the intuition, experience and support to make good judgements. We value our people because they have a spark and because they have the ability to see a spark in others.\n\n We value our independence enabling us to reach families who may not respond positively to statutory services. Good partnership with all agencies is key to children, young people and their families receiving services they need. \n\n We place the child at the centre of any work we do and promote their participation in planning, delivery and evaluation of these services. Each child in each situation requires a unique response that meets their needs, and we adapt accordingly.  This philosophy ensures those without power have a voice and are able to build resilience and confidence in themselves whilst receiving the service that is most likely to work for them. Children who are listened to become empowered and adults that listen to children are also empowered to make better, informed decisions. \n\nWe offer a range of direct services for children, young people and vulnerable adults.\n\nThese include:\n\nIndependent Visiting\nChild protection advocacy\nLooked after advocacy\nVisiting advocacy\nParticipation\nMentoring for care leavers \nIndependent Persons at Secure Reviews\nReturn from Missing Interviews",

I’ve found this is a great way of getting through to people.\n\n“Our happy hormone endorphin is released through movement and we leave sessions feeling happier and healthier.”\n\nAttendees can also suggest any “inspiring music” for everyone to dance to.\n\nAnd afterwards up to six people can stay for a socially distanced chat if they wish – “so they can support each other” – which many are grateful for.",

For example:\n \n\nHealth – the UK has the highest level of childhood obesity in Europe with one in five children obese by the time they leave primary school[i]. Just 15% of girls aged 11-15 and 22% of boys achieve the government recommended guidelines of an hour of moderate exercise each day[ii].\n\nExclusion – disabled people are four times more likely to be out of work than non-disabled people[iii] and only 18% of disabled people regularly engage in sport despite 70% wanting to[iv]. A 2017 UN inquiry concluded that the UK was not ensuring the UN Convention on Disabled People’s Rights.\n\nHardship – more than half of all children in the UK’s poorest areas are now growing up in poverty[v] and poverty is also experienced by nearly half of all families in which there is a disabled person[vi]\n\nSport is an incredibly powerful way to combat these issues and to transform the lives not only of deprived young people but also their families and surrounding communities. And yet, despite this, our most deprived communities are very often those most lacking in accessible sporting facilities.",

Our work inspires young people to achieve significant changes in their lives, from returning to school and exiting gangs to getting work and feeling healthier and happier.\n\nWe are sharing our winning formula to reach even more young people. Among other things, we are mobilising local organisations to deliver our work and we are contributing to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Boxing to build a case to the Government for how sport can improve mental health.",

    "description": "We envision a global economy that uses business as a force for good. This economy is comprised of a new type of business which is purpose driven and creates benefit for all stakeholders, not just shareholders.\nAs leaders of this emerging economy we believe that we must be the change we seek in the world. That all business ought to be conducted as if people and planet mattered. That through their products, practices and profits, businesses should aspire to do no harm and benefit all. To do so requires that we act with the understanding that we are each dependent upon one another and thus responsible for each other and future generations.\n\n\nIt is with this increasing recognition that we need better ways to account for the social, economic and environmental value that results from our activities. The language varies – ‘impact’, ‘returns’, ‘benefit’, ‘value’ – but the questions around what sort of difference and how much of a difference we are making are the same. Understanding and managing this broader value is becoming increasingly important for the public and private sectors alike. This is true whether it is civil society organisations working to create value, Governments commissioning and investing in activities to create social value, investors seeking to ensure that their investments will make a difference, or private businesses recognising both risk and opportunity in the wider effects of operations. \n\nAll this means that it is also more important that we have some consistency and a shared language when we talk about value. Social Return On Investment (SROI) is the application of a set of principles within a framework that is designed to help bring about that consistency, whilst at the same time recognising that what is of value will be very different for different people in different situations and cultures.",

At that time I found my spiritual path, the Naqshbandi Sufi lineage, and my spiritual teacher Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee. This path, in combination with therapy, helped me to reconnect with myself.\n\nAfter that period I decided to train as a psychotherapist to help others. I chose to train in Core Process Psychotherapy because I believe any healing journey is a spiritual one, that must be undertaken with a psycho-spiritual approach. At the moment I am a Senior trainee psychotherapist, studying for accreditation at the Karuna Institute, and am offering these sessions whilst completing my training. I am fully insured, I am  UKCP and ACPP  registered and all my work in supervised according to professional and ethical requirements. \n\nPreviously, I worked as a designer for different companies while living in Spain, and also in the UK where I have been living for around a decade now. I can offer therapy sessions in both English and Spanish.\n\n I offer an 30 min intro session free of charge and affordable rate of £30 for an hour session. I practice at the Practice Rooms in Southville, Stokes Croft and Westbury on Trim. Please get in touch for more information.",
