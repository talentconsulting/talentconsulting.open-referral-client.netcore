      "description": "High Notes Music Lessons. Exciting tailor-made music lessons in Amersham for children and adults.\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to Music (from 3 years)\r\nGeneral Music Lessons (from 5 years)\r\nPrivate Piano Lessons (from 5 years)\r\n\r\nEvery 2 years I hold a concert with my pupils. March 2020 was our fifth concert. We showcase our talents as 'musicians' whilst playing within our comfort zones. As some of my students come for general music lessons, these are not piano concerts but music concerts featuring a wide variety of instruments.\r\n\r\nThose participating are involved in three performances: a solo, an ensemble featuring everyone, plus a small group piece a duet, trio, quartet, or quintet. There is no age limit for those playing in the concerts with past events involving children from 3 to 14 years old, as well as grown-up pupils and of course, myself.\r\n\r\nPlease check the website or contact me for further details.\r\n",

We include a demonstration of rounding a billet on the shave horse and show how a chair leg is turned on the pole and treadle lathes. Besides the various old tools, we also have a display of  chairs and provide an explanation of the history and different types of Windsor chairs.   \r\n  \r\nKraft Village also has a contemporary art gallery, craft gift shop and Kraftinwood wood-turning workshop, enquire about wood-turning lessons from Robert an RPT registered turner supported by the Worshipful Company of Turners.

      "description": "We are London’s first specialist day college for children and young people with complex autism. \r\n\r\nAt Ambitious College we offer young people specialist education and support and provide the vocational and community-based opportunities they need to make a successful transition to an active life in their community, including partnerships with local employers and services. \r\n\r\nOur co-located approach enables us to extend our curriculum significantly and offer learners a wide range of mainstream vocational learning, social opportunities and work experience. \r\n\r\nOur learners are at the heart of everything we do and their curriculum is highly personalised to help them achieve their goals. Within the curriculum, we embed functional literacy and numeracy, positive behaviour support, communication skills development and ICT skills development. \r\n\r\nWe’re here to support young people with autism to achieve the life they want. \r\n\r\nTo do this we follow the four pathways developed by Preparing for Adulthood:\r\n\r\nVocational Learning\r\nIndependent Living\r\nBetter Health\r\nFriends, Relationships and Community\r\n\r\nLearners, where there is an assessed need for it, have one to one support provided. The learner is at the centre of their study programme. Where possible they set and agree on their own learning targets or this is done involving their circles of support. \r\n\r\nThere are monthly and annual learner reviews of progress that are set up and facilitated with the full input of the learner and to which parents and any other relevant parties attend to review and reset goals.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is delivered by our very skilled and friendly staff. Staff are trained in a variety of communication methods including PECS, and Makaton. They also communicate in print and use iPads and assistive technologies where appropriate. \r\n\r\nOur curriculum is delivered through a trans-disciplinary team consisting of:\r\n\r\nQualified Teacher(s): plan and deliver sessions around the four Preparing for Adulthood pathways\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapist(s): support learners to develop their communication and social interaction skills\r\n\r\nOccupational Therapist(s): help learners to manage sensory issues and develop functional life skills\r\n\r\nBehavioural Analyst(s): work with learners to overcome behavioural issues which could create barriers to learning\r\n\r\nEmployment specialist(s): support learners to develop vocational skills and access work experience\r\n\r\nLearning and Behaviour Specialist(s): work with learners to access their person-centred curriculum and mainstream and community provision We know with the right support and opportunities, children and young people with autism can learn, thrive and achieve.\r\n\r\nCost by arrangement. Our learners are funded by local authorities, usually from education budgets with some input from social care and/or health as best meets the young person’s needs. Personal budgets can be used for the service, though we are in the early stages of exploring this with families and local authorities.\r\n\r\nLocal authority, parents or self-referral.",

Within the curriculum, we embed functional literacy and numeracy, positive behaviour support, communication skills development and ICT skills development.\r\n\r\nWe’re here to support young people with autism to achieve the life they want. To do this we follow the four pathways developed by Preparing for Adulthood:\r\n\r\nVocational Learning\r\nIndependent Living\r\nBetter Health\r\nFriends, Relationships and Community\r\n\r\nLearners, where there is an assessed need for it, have one to one support provided.\r\n\r\nThe learner is at the centre of their study programme. Where possible they set and agree on their own learning targets or this is done involving their circles of support. \r\nThere are monthly and annual learner reviews of progress that are set up and facilitated with the full input of the learner and to which parents and any other relevant parties attend to review and reset goals.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is delivered by our very skilled and friendly staff. Staff are trained in a variety of communication methods including PECS, and Makaton. They also communicate in print and use iPads and assistive technologies where appropriate.\r\n\r\nOur curriculum is delivered through a trans-disciplinary team consisting of:\r\n\r\nQualified Teacher(s): plan and deliver sessions around the four Preparing for Adulthood pathways\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapist(s): support learners to develop their communication and social interaction skills\r\n\r\nOccupational Therapist(s): help learners to manage sensory issues and develop functional life skills\r\n\r\nBehavioural Analyst(s): work with learners to overcome behavioural issues which could create barriers to learning\r\n\r\nEmployment specialist(s): support learners to develop vocational skills and access work experience\r\n\r\nLearning and Behaviour Specialist(s): work with learners to access their person-centred curriculum and mainstream and community provision\r\n\r\nAmbitious College is located on the Tottenham Campus at the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East, London N15 4RU and West Thames College, West Thames College, London Rd, Isleworth TW7 4HS.\r\n\r\nOur co-located approach enables us to extend our curriculum significantly and offer learners a wide range of mainstream vocational learning, social opportunities and work experience.",
